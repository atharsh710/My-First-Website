            <p class="mb-5 leading-relaxed">I love to be around Tech and Computers and as a Student want to learn more about Software, A.I., Cyber-Security and many more. <b>Internet</b> a savior which always comes in our day–to-day lives. 
              Growing up, I was not aware of the wonders Internet can do. Got my first personal Computer at age 10 and that to without Internet, sounds useless right. Years passed and computers became a real deal.</p>
            <p class="mb-5 leading-relaxed">The main thing which really attracted me about Computers and Internet was Programming/Coding. When I watched Marvel’s Ironman back in a day, I came across a fictional artificial intelligence “J.A.R.V.I.S”, and that’s how I heard about A.I. first time in my life. 
              Then researching and watching coding tutorials helped me know about software, artificial intelligence, coding. Programming depends on how good are you in logic building and its algorithms.</p>
            <p class="mb-5 leading-relaxed">My first computer language is C language. As a curious student I always wanted to create my first ever website and that’s how looking for tutorials helped me to build one,(though it’s not what “web programmers” do but just wanted to build one for me).</p>
            <p class="mb-5 leading-relaxed">Programming and Coding is like super power for Internet, Software, Cyber Security and many more. <b>Cyber Security</b> can hold a crucial value in today’s lives or even in future, <b>Software developing</b> is where Software based coding comes in play, <b>UI and UX</b> is what you need to build while creating any application or website for good experience.
              <b>Data algorithms</b> are also effective in today’s world, <b>Artificial Intelligence</b> can be future for Human kind, there are multi-national companies who are openly supporting A.I for better experience avoiding human efforts. </p>
            <p class="mb-5 leading-relaxed">It’s not always Internet has advantages, but it can have disadvantages too like Cyber-attacks, hackers messing up with the security, not to forget privacy can be violated because for malwares.</p>
            <p class="mb-5 leading-relaxed">Speaking for what I love about <b>Programming/Coding</b> is we have millions of outcomes and solutions to fix internet or even to break things if are placed wrongly. Watching Ironman, The Social Network, Documentaries based on real life Internet geeks, or even founders of multi-millionaire companies is what can shape you to think about coding, internet, technology etc.
              Personally, I was impressed by the movie <b>“The Social Network”</b> directed by David Fincher which was based on real life story of Mark Zuckerberg, who creates a social networking site, Facebook, with his friend Eduardo's help. This movie really amazed me and put me in a thought to further pursue as a programmer.</p>
            <p class="mb-5 leading-relaxed">Back in a day, my parents wanted me to choose Engineering as career (as typical Indian parents do). But unfortunately, I didn’t get into Engineering and choose BCA as an option (a science student shifting to commerce stream is only thing disappointed me & my parents to be honest) though according to me, it not necessary to take engineering to get into IT field. 
              Being able to code/program is what companies need a employee to do though there are lots of stuff to be worked in IT field, yes! It can be hard to get a job without going to college but it is not at all impossible.</p>
            <p class="mb-5 leading-relaxed">Things can be mold as we wish, and as right time comes things do get placed on its own. It’s only your dedication and focus towards coding and programming skills which can make it happen in IT World.</p>
            <p class="mb-5 leading-relaxed">Long story short, I am <b>grateful</b> to each one of you for choosing to spend some of your valuable time to read this blog. Soon I am coming with cool and amazing tech topics, <b>Stay Tuned!</b> Have a blessed day :) </p>
